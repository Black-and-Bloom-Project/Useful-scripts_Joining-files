# Useful scripts: Joining files

Version of this script: V01  (May 2020)
Author: Nuno Canha

# Goal of the script:

This script aims to join several similar files in an unique file. For this, the script checks a folder for a specific type of file (csv, txt, ...) and join them according to selected collumns.
This example uses the hourly data for the KAN_M weather station (PROMICE) that is available in the following link (the files used in the example are available to download with the script):
https://promice.org/PromiceDataPortal/#Automaticweatherstations
